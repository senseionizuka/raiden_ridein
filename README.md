#  raiden_ridein

Pretty **Raiden Shogun–themed** Discord Rich Presence for Genshin Impact   

Because Eternity deserves to be displayed properly.

---

##  What is this?

A small Python script that:

- Detects when Genshin Impact is running  
- Connects to Discord Rich Presence  
- Updates your status with Raiden Shogun energy   
- Silently watches over your Primogem grind  

Totally normal behavior. Definitely not devotion.

## ⚠ Windows Defender Warning

Sometimes Windows may flag `raiden_ridein.exe` as malware. :( 

This happens because:
- The executable is built using **PyInstaller**
- PyInstaller is commonly used by attackers
- Unsigned executables can trigger false positives

If you don't trust the prebuilt executable (which is fair), build it yourself.

##  Do It Yourself!

### 1. Download
- `raiden_ridein.py`
- `raiden.ico` (optional icon)

### 2. Install PyInstaller

```bash
pip install pyinstaller
```
